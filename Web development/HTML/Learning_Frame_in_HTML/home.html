    “Bihar Institute of Economic Development” was established in 1973 to carry out research aimed at facilitating socio-economic development. In 1975, to preserve the memory of late Lalit Narayan Mishra, the then Union Railway Minister, the Institute was renamed as “Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development and Social Change (LNMI)” and very soon it diversified into education with courses in Office Management, Business Management, Marketing & Sales Management and Personnel Management & Industrial Relations. As the demand for the various Management Programmes changed with time, some of these courses were dropped, others modified, and new ones added. Later on, the Institute was taken over by the Government of Bihar.Presently, the Institute offers courses in Management and Computer Science with appropriate support systems.

The Institute’s campus is centrally located at 1, Nehru Marg, Patna, west of Patna High Court and south of Patna Women’s College. Glorious existence for over 40 years itself reflects its excellent success in the areas of Management and Computer Education, Research and Training not only inside the country but abroad also.
